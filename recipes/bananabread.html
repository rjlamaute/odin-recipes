        <h1><strong>3 Ingredient Banana Bread</strong></h1>
        <img src = "../images/bananabread.jpeg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This beautiful yet simple banana bread comes together with just three basic, easy-to-find ingredientsâ€” bananas, eggs and store-bought cake mix! 
            The bananas make this quick bread moist and sweet, while the spice cake mix adds a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg. 
            Cut the banana bread into thick slices and serve for breakfast, dessert or even an indulgent snack.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large ripe bananas</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>One 15.25-ounce box spice cake mix</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 
            Line a 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan with parchment, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the longer sides.</li>
            <li>Mash 3 of the bananas with a fork in a large bowl until very smooth, 
                reserving the fourth and least-bruised banana for the bread topper. 
                Whisk in the eggs and cake mix until just combined and no lumps remain.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the prepared loaf pan, smoothing out the top with a small offset spatula. 
                Slice the remaining banana in half lengthwise, then place the halves cut-side up on top of the batter, 
                with the curves facing each other. 
                Bake until deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the loaf pan to a wire rack to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. 
                Run a knife or offset spatula around the edges of the pan, 
                then invert the banana bread onto the wire rack and cool completely. </li>
        </ol>
