        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This beautiful yet simple banana bread comes together with just three basic, easy-to-find ingredientsâ€” bananas, eggs and store-bought cake mix! 
            The bananas make this quick bread moist and sweet, while the spice cake mix adds a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg. 
            Cut the banana bread into thick slices and serve for breakfast, dessert or even an indulgent snack.</p>
